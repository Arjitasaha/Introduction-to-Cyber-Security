Summary of My Knowledge

I gained my knowledge in cyber security, internet, cloud computing, computer networking during my bachelor in computer science and engineering. There are multiple courses I completed related to these topics.

Cyber security : I completed a course CSE447  where I learned about various algorithms widely used in the field, including different key generation methods such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and ECC. I also studied symmetric encryption techniques like AES and DES. I gained knowledge about different types of cyber attacks and cryptanalysis strategies used to break encryption. I explored the significance of public and private keys, their roles in securing communications, and their importance in cryptographic systems. Furthermore, I studied various hashing techniques, understanding how they work and their applications in cybersecurity.

Cloud Computing : The delivery of computer services, like servers, storage, databases, networking, and analytics, via the internet, enabling adaptable and scalable resource management, is known as cloud computing. I have also explored AWS courses, gaining insight into cloud services, infrastructure, and deployment concepts. I haven't completed a specific course on cloud computing yet, but I have a basic understanding of how it works, particularly in computing and resource management.

Computer network and internet : I enrolled in a Level 4 course called CSE421: Computer Networks, where I gained both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience. As part of the course, we used Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate and configure network environments, allowing me to apply networking concepts in a practical setting. 

I understand subnetting in IPv4, including how to calculate subnets and IP addressing. I also have knowledge of network protocols such as TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP/HTTPS, and DNS, understanding their roles in data transmission and communication across networks.

Protocol architectures layers and layer working mechanisms. The OSI model has seven layers, each layer handling specific functions. All layers work together to ensure seamless data exchange across networks.
